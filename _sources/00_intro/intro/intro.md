# Introduction

Welcome to Quantitative Environmental Sciences, a new course offered at 1B in Natural Sciences.

Quantitative Environmental Sciences (QES) is a multidisciplinary course designed to integrate the physics, maths, biology, and chemistry behind environmental issues and models of environmental systems.
Students will explore how Natural Sciences will be instrumental in solving the real-world problems that we are currently facing and will continue to face in the coming decades.
The course is broadly structured around the presentation of key environmental systems, and the fundamental mathematical principles underlying designing models to study environmental challenges.
Students will also gain experience in breaking down scientific challenges to policy makers through writing a policy paper.
