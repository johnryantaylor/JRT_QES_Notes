```{glossary}

Aquiclude
    Sometime refered to as an *aquifuge*;
    a rock with very low {term}`hydraulic conductivity` that acts as an impermeable barrier to groundwater flow.

Aquifer
    A body of permerable rock that is capable of storing significant quantities of water,
    underlain by impermeable material.
     
Aquitard
    A rock with low values of {term}`hydraulic conductivity`, but that still allows some flow of groundwater through it.

Artisan Well
    A well that flows without pumping
    because the hydraulic head in the {term}`confined aquifer<Confined Aquifer>` that feeds it is greater than that at ground level.

Confined Aquifer
    An {term}`aquifer` that is sealed by impermeable rock above and below.

DIC
    **D**issolved **I**norganic **C**arbon - the sum of $CO_2$, $H_2CO_3$, $HCO_3^-$ and $CO_3^{2-}$ in water. 

Discharge
    The amount of water flowing at a particular point.

Elevation Head
    The height in m above the reference datum, which is usually mean sea level in groundwater systems.

Hydraulic Conductivity
    A combination of the physical properties of a fluid and the {term}`permeability` of the medium it is flowing through which descibes how quickly the fluid can move through it, termed $K$. This is a key property of hydrogeologic systems which is highly variable (12 orders of magnitude!) depending on rock type.

Hydraulic Gradient
    The difference in {term}`hydraulic head` per unit distance, $\dv{h}{l}$

Hydraulic Head
    A measure of liquid pressure at a particular place (depth) relative to some datum (usually mean sea level). Descibes the amount of energy available in the system. Can be subdivided into the {term}`pressure head` and {term}`elevation head` (also kinetic head, although this is negligible in groundwater systems).

Infiltration
    The downward entry of water into soil.

Ocean Acidification
    A reduction in ocean pH caused by the dissolution of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ into water.

Percolation
    The downward movement of water through soil.

Permeability
    The physical characteristics of a porous medium that allow water to flow through it. Related to {term}`porosity`, but not identical - a porous rock is not necessarily permeable.

Porosity
    The total sum of all void spaces in a rock. Often expressed as a percentage, or a number between 1 and 0. Not all these spaces may be connected, however, so for water flow, the *effective porosity* is the amount of void space that can hold and transmit water.

Pressure Head
    The total absolute pressure exerted on a point in the system, expressed in m.

Recharge
    The downward movement of water from the soil to the {term}`water table<Water Table>`.
    
Residence Time
    The average time that a given substance remains in a reservoir.

Total Alkalinity
    A conservative quantity that can be used to track the equilibrium state of weak acids in water. Calculated as the sum of the negative ions of weak acids, minus $\mathrm{[H^+]}$, this does not change as acid-base equilibria shift with temperature because it includes both the acid and base component of the system.
    
Reynolds Number
    The ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces within a fluid. Fluids with a large Reynolds Numberare dominated by intertial forces, and fluids with a small Reynolds Number are dominated by viscous drag.

Transmissivity
    The ability of an {term}`aquifer` to transmit groundwater throughout its entire saturated thickness.

Solubility Pump
    The movement of carbon around the ocean by physical-chemical processes. Surface water cools as it travels to higher latitude, allowing it to store more C and DIC. This downwells into the deep ocean, where it remains until that water is upwelled. The warming of upwelling water releases the stored C back into the atmosphere.

Specific Discharge
    The flow rate through a system divided by its cross sectional area, $q$.

Storativity
    The volume of water released from storage per unit decline in hydraulic head in the aquifer, per unit area of the aquifer

Unconfined Aquifer
    An {term}`aquifer` where the {term}`water table<Water Table>` defines the upper water limit.  

Water Footprint
    The total amount of water it takes to manufacture something.

Water Table
    The upper surface of groundwater, or the level below which an {term}`aquifer` is permamently saturated with water.
