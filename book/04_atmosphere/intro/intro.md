# Air Pollution and Atmospheric Chemistry

__Lecture 19 – An overview of the atmosphere__
+++
During this lecture we will review the structure (layers) of the atmosphere.
We will use physical principles to determine how mass changes and why.
We will review what causes variations in temperature in the atmosphere and the important role that ozone plays.
We will review the most important radiatively active gases/aerosols in the atmosphere.

__Lecture 20 – Air pollution__
+++
During this lecture we will define what comprises air pollution.
We will identify the main air pollutants as nitrogen dioxide ($\mathrm{NO_2}$) and particulate matter (PM) and look at their sources and sinks.
We will review historical trends and the current distribution as viewed in situ and from space (through application of the Beer-Lambert law).

__Lecture 21 - The chemistry of pollutants__
+++
During this lecture we will review the mechanism of loss of pollutants in the atmosphere.
This occurs through four main routes: gas-phase oxidation, heterogeneous uptake, photolysis and gas-to-aerosol partitioning.
We will calculate how these different processes impact the lifetime of a pollutant and calculate the steady state burden of $\mathrm{NO_2}$. 

__Lecture 22 - Aerosols__
+++
This lecture describes the basic characteristics of atmospheric particulate matter, such as formation processes, sources, removal processes, chemical composition, and size distribution.
It also outlines kinetic processes determining heterogeneous reaction rates, and the describes the resistance model for uptake of gases into the condensed phase (particles and droplets).

__Lecture 24 - Air pollution and climate: indirect effects__
+++
This lecture describes how aerosols affect climate through their interaction with clouds.
It introduces the role of aerosols in cloud formation, the Koehler theory and rate of droplet growth.
It introduces also the role of aerosols in modifying cloud properties such as cloud optical thickness, lifetime, and albedo.

__Lecture 23 - Air pollution and climate: direct effects__
+++
This lecture introduces health impacts of aerosols, how effects are linked with chemical composition and size, and what are the main methodologies to assess health impacts (toxicology vs. epidemiology approaches).
It also describes the direct effects that aerosols have on climate, through scattering and absorbing radiation.
