# Ocean Carbon

This section of the course we will examine how chemical and biological processes combine with the physical circulation processes you saw in the last lecture block to regulate the exchange of carbon between the ocean and the atmosphere.

In parallel with these lectures you will create a numerical model of carbon in the ocean, including all the processes we discuss. This will form part of the Lab Report for the course.
