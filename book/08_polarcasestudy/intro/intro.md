# Polar Case Study

The high-latitude polar regions are experiencing some of the most rapid recent climatic and environmental change observed on Earth.
Not only are these regions vulnerable, but the polar ocean, land and cryosphere are also involved in a multitude of climate feedback processes.
We will explore examples of different shipboard, autonomous and remote sensing observations we can make in the oceans across different disciplines and on a range of temporal and spatial scales, to understand the changes underway in the polar regions and why they matter.
